                    Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is the most widely used
                    method for detection of infectious agents in clinical
                    samples by specific amplification of their nucleic acids.
                    However, PCR requires thermal cycling therefore an
                    instrument called thermal cycler which is only available in
                    molecular biology laboratories. Therefore PCR cannot be used
                    as a point of care diagnostic methods. In order to amplify
                    double stranded DNA the first step is the denaturation of
                    double strands by heating DNA to 95°C in the thermal cycler.
                    There is also loop mediated amplification technique (LAMP)
                    that can do DNA amplification without requiring thermal
                    cycling; however, it still requires a heating block since
                    isothermal amplification by LAMP is achieved at 65°C.
                    <br />Our inspiration is to generate the path to the new
                    rapid, easy, low cost and accurate diagnostic tests.

                    As known, detection of infectious agents are diagnosed
                    mostly by using PCR or rapid antigen-antibody interaction
                    tests in clinical samples. But PCR is not practical since
                    they require expensive laboratory instruments and
                    experienced laboratory personnel. On the other hand, antigen
                    tests are diagnostic tests that give results in a short
                    time, however with less sensitivity due to lack of signal
                    amplification ability like DNA or RNA templates.

                    Our method depends on cutting one strand of double stranded
                    DNA by a nicking enzyme and separation of strands from each
                    other by strand displacement activity of DNA polymerase.
                    <br />
                    For nucleic acid amplification, DNA strands are separated at
                    room temperature by using the nicking enzyme. When a nicking
                    enzyme breaks the sugar phosphate bond of one strand the
                    3’end of DNA functions like a primer where DNA polymerase
                    binds and starts elongating DNA on one strand. During this
                    DNA synthesis, the other strand is displaced separating the
                    two strands from each other. Amplification of double
                    stranded DNA is achieved by DNA synthesis on the displaced
                    strand using reverse primers. The new signal amplification
                    method can easily adapt to the nucleic acid sequence of
                    various infectious agents in clinical samples specifically.
